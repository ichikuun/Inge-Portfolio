    <p>
Zoom Park’s responsibility towards its participants is to provide a safe place for you to have fun, to inform you of the risks involved in using the Park as well as to help minimise the risk of harm to you and any children that you are responsible for.
<br><br>
In this regard, the waiver is an important part of this safety safeguard as it makes sure that you understand and agree to abide by our safety rules, which includes following any instructions from our staff, agree to make sure that any children you are responsible for abide by our rules too and understand that you and any children you are responsible for use the park at your own risk.
<br><br>
This is a norm for all trampoline park as unanticipated risks from your usage cannot be eliminated.  In addition, while our employees seek to create a safe environment but they are not infallible as they may not be aware of participant’s health or abilities.  Hence, while we can create the environment for participants, it is the participant responsibility to understand the risks associated with the sports and to be fully aware that they are using the facilities at the Park at their own risk.

    <h2 style="color: yellow; margin-bottom: 12px;">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <p style="margin-right: 210px;">
<b>DO I NEED TO MAKE RESERVATIONS?</b>
<br>
Reservation is highly recommended but it is not necessary. We accept walk ins as well but we cannot guarantee a spot as we can only cater a certain number of people in the park in order to ensure the safety of our jumpers.
<br><br>
<b>CAN I CANCEL MY TICKETS? WOULD I GET A REFUND?</b>
<br>
Sorry, tickets are non-refundable and there is no re-scheduling of tickets. This is to be fair for our jumpers who have booked their slots in advance.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NORMAL RESERVATION AND A PARTY RESERVATION?</b>
<br>
A normal reservation is when you book a slot for yourself or a group to jump in the park, whereas a party reservation is when you book a party room for a party or events. Please check out the packages under Events.
<br><br>
<b>DO I NEED TO SIGN A WAIVER BEFORE I CAN JUMP?</b>
<br>
Yes. Every jumper needs to have a signed liability waiver on file at Zoom Park prior to being allowed on the trampoline area. If you are under 18 years of age, a parent or legal guardian above the age of 21 must fill out the waiver for you, but does not have to be present when you visit the park.
<br><br>
<b>IF I COMPLETED A WAIVER ONCE, DO I NEED TO SIGN ONE AGAIN?</b>
<br>
Once completed, a waiver is valid for one full year from the day it was signed.
