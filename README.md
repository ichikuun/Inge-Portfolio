# Inge's Portfolio

This is Inge's resume and portfolio in media. It can be accessed through www.ingeshi.space.

# Design

This website is made to function as a neat and clean resume that still functions as a portfolio. I just inserted portfolio content into lists like it is part of the resume. Of course, by doing this I'm missing out on the visual impact of having graphics, but reversely, locking them behind a click also piques people's interests and keep them clicking to see more.

I have always had black backgrounds and what I think now are gloomy-looking websites, but I wanted to renovated the space and chose a brighter colour scheme. There is no colour combination quite like blue and red, and I marvel at their synergy every day. With that in mind, they serve as accent colours to a slightly gray background that isn't as hard as white on the eyes.
