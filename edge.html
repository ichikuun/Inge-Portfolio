    About: In the March holidays of 2017, I went on a school trip to Tianjin and made a magazine for the awesome 35-day trip. I wrote and rewrote articles, drafted layout designs and slaved over the creation of this magazine I proudly call EDGE.</p></div>

      <h2 style="font-size: 16px;">Five Boulevards - An Old World for the Young</h2>
      <p class="caption" style="width: 490px; float: left;">From fairy-tale cameos to hipster cafes, INGE SHI uncovers the wonder behind Wudadao, one of Tianjin's most iconic landmarks.</p>
      <img class="pic" style="width: 490px; float: left;" src="images/five.png"></img>
      <p class="caption1" style="width: 490px; float: left;"><br>The normal Tianjin, a city two hours away from Beijing, is one of mundane structures and unbelievably delicious savoury crepes, with drab cars and angry taxis weaving in and out of this concrete jungle. But delve into the heart of it – just a 10-minute drive from the shopping haven and city centre Binjiang Street, and one will find a startlingly beautiful paradox.
      <br><br>
      Framed by the area around five main streets, this area looks pasted straight from a European city street. Meticulously arranged in a grid, unlike the rest of Tianjin, the Five Boulevards is named aptly after the five streets that are its veins and blood.
      <br><br>
      Sightseeing at the Five Boulevards, known as Wudadao to locals, is best experienced on fancy horse-drawn carts, some fashioned like Cinderella’s pumpkin carriage. Travelling on foot, just like our forefathers before the invention of the affordable automobile, is just as pleasant with Tianjin’s agreeable weather. Yet, what really completes the experience of a different century is the leaning lampposts and red clay bricks peeking out from every corner of Western-style houses. One would think shopping malls would be the favourite haunt of young people, but the Boulevards’ rustic streets and old-world feel is surprisingly popular among young adults and college students.
      <br><br>
      Boasting more than 230 buildings of various European styles, from Spanish garden villas to elaborate French mansions, the Boulevards’ impressive assortment of architectural styles is a fascinating window into 19th-century Tianjin. It was a time in history when Tianjin’s proximity to Haihe river and the sea makes this sprawling city the perfect gateway for foreign ships. Such concession-era buildings were built to house Western dignitaries when Tianjin was first opened to foreign trade in 1860.
      <br><br>
      “These are not just any ordinary buildings,” says Ms Hao Yuan Yuan, a 23-year-old graphic designer who brought a friend to Five Boulevards. “These are French and German architecture. And we came here to see it.”
      <br><br>
      Yet, under the preserved European allure and past fences of colourful courtyards lie shops of every nature imaginable.
      <br><br>
      Along Chongqing Street, where most of the best dining spots are situated, novelty boutiques such as antique cafés line the road. For bigger meals, one can find a large variety of foreign cuisine, such as authentic Japanese hotpot and American burgers.
      <br><br>
      There is also abundance of clubs and bars around the area attracts hordes of people to Minyuan Plaza. One of the most reputable establishments is a club named VICS that was opened by Na Ying, a well-known Chinese singer, located right at the entrance to the plaza.
      <br><br>
      Mrs Dong Huan Yeng, 72, has lived here for 40 years and says that the Five Boulevards is at its most beautiful in May. The flower trees along the avenues flower in late April and reach full blossom by May.
      <br><br>
      A peaceful enclave inside Tianjin’s bustling cityscape, the Five Boulevards is a must-visit for travellers. Its classical ambience and architecture complements its modern use, the perfect blend of the traditional and the contemporary. If you have a few hours in Tianjin, where else but in the Five Boulevards could you get a crash course in the city’s modern culture and history?

      <h2 style="font-size: 16px;">China's Pampered</h2>
      <p class="caption" style="width: 490px; float: left;">INGE SHI reveals the real soft spot of stoic urbanites – pets.</p>
      <img class="pic" style="width: 490px; float: left;" src="images/dog.png"></img>
      <p class="caption1" style="width: 490px; float: left;"><br>As celebrations for Lunar New Year come to a close, Mdm Chen Qi can finally take a breather after the busiest time of the year for her store.
      <br><br>
      Mdm Chen, 56 and owner of four dogs, runs a small pet boutique in Tianjin, a few hours’ drive away from Beijing. Inside are rows of local and imported pet food packaged well enough to belong in the aisle of a supermarket for humans (German goat’s milk pudding, anybody?). Canine mannequins line the top shelves, clothed in the latest doggy fashion. It’s not surprising that this 60-metre-square store also serves as a beauty salon, spa parlour and boarding house – all for our furry friends, of course.
      <br><br>
      In China, the pet care business is booming. Euromonitor International reports that the pet industry is predicted to grow by more than 50 per cent from the current value of RMB97.8 billion (S$20.5 billion), outpacing the world’s biggest pet care market, the United States.
      <br><br>
      Pet shops such as Mdm Chen’s boutique are the backbone of the industry’s rapid growth. In China, there are more than 30,000 pet stores in operation, three times that of the US.
      <br><br>
      Most of these pet shops will experience an influx of customers during the Lunar New Year period.
      <br><br>
      “People will come to dye their dogs’ fur red, like this,” Mdm Chen says as she points to her mixed breed’s orange puff of a tail.
      <br><br>
      Belying their popularity is the price of such salon visits – beauty treatments are not for the weak of wallet. Shops charge anywhere from RMB100-200 (S$21-42) for a simple shower, depending on size and fur length. Meanwhile, hair colouring and fanciful cuts can cost upwards of RMB500(S$104).
      <br><br>
      Even without the manicures and grooming sessions, just keeping a dog at home can bite a sizable chunk off one’s salary.
      <br><br>
      “It’s not uncommon to spend RMB1000(S$208) a month on pet food,” says Mr Yang Zhi Yuan, a 28-year-old convenience store owner.
      <br><br>
      “I know many people who buy fresh vegetables, eggs and meat to cook daily for their dogs,” manager of Miya Animal Hospital, Tianjin’s biggest veterinarian centre, Mrs Huang Min agrees.
      <br><br>
      Despite the exorbitant upkeep, dogs are still very popular among Chinese citizens.
      <br><br>
      In 2014, China reached a total of 27.4 million pet dogs, ranking third after the United States and Brazil, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China.
      <br><br>
      As the popular saying goes, a dog is man’s best friend. But in China, dogs are more than just that – owners see their furred charges as their own flesh and blood.
      <br><br>
      “We raise them as our own children,” Mr Yang explains fondly, as his poodle crossbreed quirkily named Ergazi sits meekly beside him at the cashier counter. “That’s why we want only the best for them.”
      <br><br>
      “We were so worried,” Mdm Chen recounts, face scrunched up in an anxious frown. “One of our huskies fell sick when he was a cub. Momo had to be hospitalised for weeks. He’s fine now, but the medical bill was more than RMB7000 (S$1458).”
      <br><br>
      Many owners are willing to shell out big dollars for their canines. Animal hospitals, such as the one Mrs Huang manages, can receive up to 15 patients a day. Most of them are for check-ups or to cure common maladies like the flu and vomiting, not to mention odder inflictions such as a toy or two in some poor dog’s stomach.
      <br><br>
      Even when all is well, owners still take care of their own with much love. Mr Yang brings his pooch to work every day, and Ergazi has a small cushion specially set beside his human’s seat. Mr Yang is not the only one to have a companion at work; it’s a common sight for shops to house a few furry friends. Nevertheless, those who don’t bring their pets as an everyday companion still walk their dogs frequently. Parks in Tianjin are nearly bursting with dogs jumping around greeting other dogs, or simply investigating new lamp posts to relieve themselves on.
      <br><br>
      The obsession with pets doesn’t just end there. Pet bakeries, with some specialising in birthday cakes, are prevalent in the big cities. Worried for your pet’s future medical bills? People’s Insurance Company of China provides insurance plans for pets.
      <br><br>
      As pet care enjoys its newfound stardom, the practice of keeping dogs remains one deep-rooted in ancient Chinese culture.
      <br><br>
      Dogs were the first animals to be domesticated in China. They play an important role in Chinese mythology, usually as companions to heroes of lore like Erlang from Journey to the West. The dog is also one of the 12 Chinese zodiacs.
      <br><br>
      More recently, during the Cultural Revolution, Mao Ze Dong deemed pets as an elitist pastime. Yet nowadays, pet ownership is becoming more commonplace for the rising middle and upper classes.
      <br><br>
      Keeping pets are seen as a sign of wealth and success. While this pleases and benefits many pet owners, it does not always bode well for the animals themselves.
      <br><br>
      <i>Xinqiquan</i>, which mean week-long dogs, are named aptly for how they only survive for one week, and they are advertised as such – hassle-free and no strings attached. They are usually sold from the boot of cars crowding around a hotspot, and they go as swiftly as they come.
      <br><br>
      There is also a problem borne from the prestige of keeping pets, that happens almost everywhere. Pet abandonment is rife, as a result of people buying carelessly to bolster their reputation and not having the commitment or financial capability of maintaining one.
      <br><br>
      Just like everything else in the world, every moon that waxes wanes. Even with government efforts cracking down on illegal markets, China’s unscrupulous treatment of pets still starkly juxtapose their all-encompassing love.
      <br><br>
      In the other side of the city, the sun sets in the distance and Mdm Chen gears up to go out for dinner. All the dogs in the shop quiet in expectation. She goes to her four beloved and kisses them each goodbye. All the while, she whispers to them ‘haohaizi’, meaning good child in Mandarin.
